# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER

Named Entity means anything that is a real-world object such as a person, a place, any organisation, any product which has a name.In Machine Learning Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing to identify the named entities in a certain piece of text.

Have you ever used software known as Grammarly? It identifies all the incorrect spellings and punctuations in the text and corrects it. But it does not do anything with the named entities, as it is also using the same technique.
